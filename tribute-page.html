          <h3 id="headline">The following data with the years will give us a good understanding as how
      computers have evolved over the past.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1642</strong> - Biaise Pascal introduced the Pascaline digital machine.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1822</strong> - Charlet Babbage introduces the Difference Engine and later the Analytical
      Engine (as he called them), a general purpose computing machine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - John V. Atanasoff created the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). This is
      considered as the first electronic computer. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945</strong> - John von Neuman specified the architecture of the EDVAC, which
      introduced the stored-program computer concept. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1946</strong> - John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert introduced the ENIAC, an electronic
      computing machine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1947</strong> - William Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen was successful in
      testing the point-contact transistor. This made the semiconductor revolution which
      helped to reduce the size of computers. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1949</strong> - Maurice Wilkes at Cambridge University released the EDSAC, the first
      real stored-program computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1952</strong> - UNIVAC I was developed and this is the first commercial computer
      which got a large amount of public attention. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1953</strong> - IBM releases the IBM 701. This is IBMs first electronic computer. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1955</strong> - Bell laboratories introduced the TRADIC, the first fully transistorized
      computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1958</strong> - Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments created the first integrated circuit (IC). 
            </li>
            <li><strong>1969</strong> - ARPAnet was developed. (This became the base for Internet later.)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1971</strong> - IBM invented the 8” floppy disk. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1972</strong> - Intel introduced the Intel 8008 microprocessor. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1973</strong> - Robert Metcalfe introduced the Ethernet method for network connections. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>1974</strong> - Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre designed the first workstation with
      mouse input available. </li>
